# 🧹 FRONTEND CLEANUP GUIDE

## 📁 CURRENT FOLDER STRUCTURE:
```
datathon/
├── backend/                    ✅ KEEP - Backend server
├── frontend-pro/              ✅ KEEP - Main working frontend (CURRENTLY RUNNING)
├── frontend/                  ❌ DELETE - Old version
├── frontend-working/          ❌ DELETE - Intermediate version  
├── simple-frontend/           ❌ DELETE - Basic version
└── other files...             ✅ KEEP
```

## 🎯 WHAT TO DO:

### ✅ KEEP THESE:
- **`frontend-pro/`** - This is your MAIN working version with all the professional features
- **`backend/`** - Your backend server
- **`README.md`**, **`setup.sh`**, etc. - Project files

### ❌ DELETE THESE:
- **`frontend/`** - Older version (not the current one)
- **`frontend-working/`** - Intermediate development version
- **`simple-frontend/`** - Basic version for testing

## 🚀 HOW TO DELETE:

### Option 1: File Explorer (Easiest)
1. Open File Explorer
2. Navigate to: `C:\Users\AKHILESH\OneDrive\Documents\datathon`
3. Right-click and delete:
   - `frontend` folder
   - `frontend-working` folder  
   - `simple-frontend` folder
4. Empty Recycle Bin when done

### Option 2: Command Line
```bash
cd "C:\Users\AKHILESH\OneDrive\Documents\datathon"
rmdir /s /q frontend
rmdir /s /q frontend-working
rmdir /s /q simple-frontend
```

## ✨ AFTER CLEANUP:
Your project will be much cleaner with just:
```
datathon/
├── backend/           - Backend server
├── frontend-pro/      - Main frontend (rename to 'frontend' if you want)
├── README.md
└── setup.sh
```

## 🎯 CURRENT STATUS:
- **React Server**: Running on http://localhost:3000 from `frontend-pro/`
- **Main Frontend**: `frontend-pro/` folder
- **All Features**: Working perfectly in the main version

## 💡 OPTIONAL: Rename for Clarity
After deleting the old folders, you can rename `frontend-pro` to just `frontend`:
```bash
mv frontend-pro frontend
```

This will make your project structure cleaner and more standard.
